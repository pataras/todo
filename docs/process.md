# Development Process

## Overview
This document describes the process for translating product requirements into user stories for the ToDo application.

## Process Steps

### 1. Brief Creation
- Product owner creates a brief outlining features and requirements
- Brief includes core features, technical requirements, and target users
- Document stored in `docs/Ideas/` folder
- Example: `docs/Ideas/todo-app-brief.md`

### 2. Terminology Definition
- Create a data dictionary to formalize terminology
- Define domain-specific terms used across the project
- Establish consistent language for user stories and technical implementation
- Documents:
  - `docs/Ideas/TERMS_DATA_DICTIONARY.md` (domain-specific terms)
  - `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` (comprehensive data dictionary)

### 3. User Story Generation
- Transform brief requirements into detailed user stories
- Follow standard user story format: "As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
- Include for each story:
  - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
  - Story points (Fibonacci sequence)
  - Dependencies
  - Acceptance criteria (testable, specific, comprehensive)
  - Technical notes
- Group stories by epic/domain area
- Create story maps for release planning
- Store in `docs/Design/UserStories/` folder

### 4. Release Planning
- Organize user stories into releases
- Group by MVP and subsequent enhancements
- Estimate effort per release
- Identify technical dependencies

### 5. Documentation Standards
- All stories follow Definition of Done criteria
- Include accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Document API contracts and technical specifications
- Keep cross-references to data dictionary

## Quality Guidelines

### User Story Acceptance Criteria
- **Testable:** Objectively verifiable
- **Specific:** Clear and unambiguous
- **User-Centric:** Written from user perspective
- **Comprehensive:** Cover happy path, edge cases, errors
- **Accessible:** Include accessibility considerations

### Story Points
- Use Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- 8+ point stories should be broken down further
- Consider complexity, uncertainty, and effort

### Priority Levels
- **High:** Must have for release
- **Medium:** Should have, adds significant value
- **Low:** Nice to have, can be deferred

## Tools and Automation

### AI-Assisted Generation
- Claude can be used to assist with user story generation
- Provide brief and data dictionary as context
- Review and refine AI-generated stories
- Ensure consistency with project standards

### Review Process
1. Product owner review for business requirements
2. Technical refinement with development team
3. Estimation and sprint planning
4. Break down large stories as needed

## Next Steps After User Stories
1. Create technical specifications for complex features
2. Design database schemas and API contracts
3. Plan sprint allocation
4. Set up task tracking in project management tool
5. Begin implementation following Definition of Done
